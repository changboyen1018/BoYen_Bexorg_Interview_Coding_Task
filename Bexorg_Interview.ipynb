This separation ensures that the GUI remains responsive by offloading the computational work of generating sine wave data away from the main thread.\n",

This architecture prevents the GUI from freezing or becoming unresponsive during intensive computation.\n",

The signal sends the newly computed `x_data` and `y_data` to the main thread, which then updates the plot displayed to the user. This keeps the plot dynamically updated without interrupting the user's interaction with the application's controls.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Safe Thread Termination**: The `stop` method in `PlotThread` ensures that the thread can be safely stopped without losing data or causing crashes.
