# Real-Time Sine Wave Plotter

## Overview
This PyQt5-based application is designed for real-time plotting of sine waves, allowing users to dynamically interact with the wave parameters such as amplitude, frequency, and offset. It showcases proficiency in using PyQt5, matplotlib, and Python for developing responsive GUI applications with complex backend computations.

## Features
- **Dynamic Plotting**: Visualize sine waves in real time with adjustable parameters.
- **Interactive GUI**: Users can start and stop the plotting process via the GUI, enhancing interaction.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes PyQt's QThread to ensure the GUI remains responsive during intensive computational tasks.
- **Data Logging**: Logs data with precise timestamps every minute to ensure accuracy and no data loss.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the Bexorg_Interview.ipynb fiile in each parts independently.

## Operating the GUI
- Amplitude, Frequency, Offset: Enter values in these fields to adjust the characteristics of the sine wave.
- Start/Stop Plotting: Click this button to begin plotting or to pause the plotting process.

## Documentation
The code is well-commented, providing detailed explanations of the functionality of each component between lines. The following sections are included:

- GUI Design: Documentation on the GUI layout and design choices.
- Functionality Integration: Descriptions of how each feature is implemented and integrated.
- Data Logging: Explanation of the data logging mechanism.
